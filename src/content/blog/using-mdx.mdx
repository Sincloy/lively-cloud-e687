At Sincloy Games, we use MDX extensively for our technical documentation and internal knowledge sharing. Here's how we leverage its capabilities:

## Why MDX for Game Development?

MDX allows us to:

- Create interactive documentation with live code examples
- Embed game development tools and visualizations
- Maintain consistent documentation across teams
- Combine technical specifications with visual examples

## Example: Game Physics Documentation

Here's how we document our physics engine using MDX:

```jsx
import PhysicsSimulator from "../../components/PhysicsSimulator.astro";

<PhysicsSimulator gravity={9.8} friction={0.5} />
```

This renders an interactive physics simulation that developers can tweak and experiment with directly in the documentation.

## Our Documentation Workflow

1. **Component Documentation**: Each game system has its own MDX file with:
   - Usage examples
   - API reference
   - Interactive demos

2. **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides with embedded code snippets

3. **Design Documents**: Combining technical specs with visual mockups

## Benefits We've Seen

- Faster onboarding for new developers
- More engaging documentation
- Reduced miscommunication between teams
- Easier maintenance of complex systems

## Getting Started with MDX

If you're interested in using MDX for your own documentation:

- [MDX Syntax Documentation](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx)
- [Astro Usage Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#markdown-and-mdx-pages)
- **Note:** Remember to use [Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) for interactive components
